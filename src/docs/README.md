🚀 Excited to share this pet project! 🎥📚

🎉 I just created a video tutorial where I guide you step-by-step in setting up an API in AWS and seamlessly connecting it to a Lambda function in less than 30 minutes! 🤩💪

🔗 In this video, I demonstrate how to leverage the power of AWS services. First, we create an API and effortlessly link it to a Lambda function. What's unique is that the Lambda function is powered by an image stored in Elastic Container Registry and built using Docker! 🚢🐳

💡 The highlight of this tutorial is the integration of OpenAI's completion function through an API call made by the Lambda function. 🤝🌐

🐍 To complete the circle, I showcase how to utilize a simple Python Streamlit app with a GET request, connecting to the API we created. It's amazing to witness the magic unfold as the app interacts with the Lambda function! 📲💻

🔥 If you're interested in AWS, APIs, Lambda functions, Docker, or OpenAI, this video is a must-watch! Don't miss out on this opportunity to expand your knowledge and level up your technical skills! 📺🔗
