2,"Foreword
As the use of artificial intelligence (AI) continues to 
grow across industries, it has become imperative 
for commercial enterprises to ensure that the AI 
solutions they procure are responsible and ethical. 
The growth of the global AI market is staggering – 
valued at $136 billion in 2022 and is estimated to  
expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) 
of 37.3% from 2023 to 2030. The growing use 
and prevalence of generative AI technology and 
the emergence of advanced GPT models – with 
their tremendous potential and unique ethical 
challenges – underscores an even greater need 
to establish standards for responsible AI practices 
and procurement.
Using AI responsibly is important not only because 
organizations have a social responsibility and a 
reputation to maintain but also for the long-term 
viability and well-being of business and society. 
That includes protecting businesses from potential 
risks down the road, particularly related to areas 
such as intellectual property, data and privacy.
While AI systems are rapidly evolving, in-house 
AI expertise often stays limited, and there are no 
standard benchmarks and assessment criteria to 
aid the end-to-end procurement process.To address this gap, the World Economic 
Forum, in partnership with GEP , has released a 
comprehensive guide for commercial organizations, 
Adopting AI Responsibly: Guidelines for 
Procurement of AI Solutions by the Private Sector.
In this report, we present a structured framework for 
evaluating the implications of acquiring AI solutions, 
emphasizing the importance of transparency, 
accountability and human-centred design from 
development to implementation. The framework 
offers guidance on evaluating potential solutions 
based on bias, privacy and security. It shares 
recommendations on integrating ethical principles 
into the procurement criteria and processes, often 
involving multiple stakeholders. Finally, it offers 
insights on how to overlay all these steps with 
strong governance criteria, ensuring that these 
principles are applied.
In short, this framework is an essential resource 
for business and procurement leaders who want 
to guarantee that their organizations are at the 
forefront of socially responsible AI adoption. Mudit Kumar

in enterprises has grown by leaps and bounds 
in the past few years, driven by improved data 
availability, advanced algorithms and increased 
processing power. While the use of AI tools delivers 
significant value, it is necessary to approach it 
carefully and avoid its potentially negative, and even 
dangerous, consequences. The World Economic 
Forum, in partnership with GEP , has released this 
comprehensive guide for commercial organizations 
– across industries – to facilitate the process of 
identifying, selecting and implementing AI solutions 
responsibly and ethically. 
This report is a practical toolkit that will help 
navigate the challenges of AI procurement  
through a structured framework. It is directional,  
not prescriptive and industry agnostic, not  
problem specific. 
It discusses the need for AI solutions to be closely 
aligned with business goals, ethical standards and 
regulatory requirements, as well as the importance 
of stakeholder collaboration and an enterprise-
wide evaluation process. It highlights five key 
considerations – business strategy, commercial 
strategy, data strategy, ethics and sustainability, 
and governance, risk and compliance – against 
which AI/machine learning (ML) solutions can be assessed for responsible AI acquisition, with 
procurement as the orchestrator driving the 
implementation of this framework.
Broadly, the report provides practical advice on:
 –Assessing AI solutions’ ethical standards and 
regulatory compliance
 –Aligning solutions with business and  
commercial goals
 –Evaluating their potential impact.
From automating repetitive tasks, reducing errors 
or risks and optimizing pricing to identifying new 
opportunities, making accurate forecasts and 
enabling investment decisions, AI solutions can 
help enterprises perform a wide range of tactical 
and strategic activities to improve efficiency and 
support growth. With careful and responsible 
procurement, organizations can harness the power 
of AI to improve their productivity and gain a

4,"Introduction
Artificial intelligence (AI) in an enterprise refers 
to the use of AI technology and applications in 
private sector organizations to improve operations, 
increase efficiency and drive growth. 
AI adoption in enterprises has grown exponentially 
over the past decade because of the greater 
availability of data, the development of more 
sophisticated algorithms and the increased 
processing power of computers. Advancements 
in cloud computing and the emergence of edge 
computing have also made implementing AI-
powered solutions easier and more cost-effective.
However, private sector enterprises find 
navigating the procurement and deployment of 
AI technologies a tremendous challenge because 
of a variety of reasons, from lack of requisite 
skills to the definition of strategy, data quality 
and established playbooks to follow. This report 
aims to facilitate the responsible and ethical 
procurement of AI/machine learning (ML) solutions 
in commercial organizations by developing 
comprehensive guidelines and a practical toolkit 
that are directional rather than prescriptive. It will 
help enterprises evaluate AI/ML solutions through a 
robust procurement framework and build a holistic 
approach for acquiring and deploying AI solutions 
to achieve organizational goals.
Why enterprises need AI
The history of AI in enterprises can be traced back 
to the early days of computing when businesses 
first began experimenting with rule-based and 
expert systems, which were designed to perform 
specific tasks, such as analysing data and making 
predictions. These systems were limited in their 
capabilities and required significant human input to 
function effectively.
In the 1990s, ML algorithms began to be 
developed, allowing AI systems to learn from data 
and improve performance over time. This marked 
a turning point in the history of enterprise AI, as 
ML-powered systems could be used to analyse 
large amounts of data and make predictions 
more efficiently and accurately. In the 2000s, 
advancements in computing power and the 
availability of large volumes of data began to drive 
the adoption of AI in enterprises. Businesses, realizing the potential of AI to improve operations 
and drive growth, started making significant 
investments in AI-powered systems.
One of the key drivers of AI is automation. AI-
powered automation can help businesses automate 
repetitive and time-consuming tasks – such as data 
entry, customer service and inventory management 
– and improve speed and accuracy as well as 
reduce costs. It can free up human workers to 
focus on more complex and strategic tasks.
AI-powered decision-making is another common 
use case in enterprises, where AI is used to analyse 
data and provide recommendations to decision-
makers. AI can be used to optimize pricing, 
identify new business opportunities or even make 
investment decisions. 
While AI is becoming an increasingly important tool 
for organizations, to fully realize its benefits, they 
need to invest in the necessary infrastructure, talent 
and technologies. Additionally, businesses should 
address the challenges associated with acquiring 
and implementing AI solutions, such as lack of 
expertise, data privacy and security concerns.
Why do we need responsible AI 
procurement guidelines?
AI/ML adoption is skyrocketing, especially  
post-COVID-19, with far-reaching impact  
on businesses
Organizations worldwide are increasingly adopting 
AI and ML to support business growth, improve 
efficiencies and gain a competitive edge. The 
global AI market is anticipated to hit the $1,500 
billion mark by 2030,1 driven by the substantial 
investments made by tech giants in R&D to 
advance technology. In many cases, AI solutions 
are deeply embedded into the organization’s 
enterprise applications, making recommendations 
and predictions and influencing critical decision-
making. Thus, it’s essential to ensure that AI 
delivers ethical, responsible and reliable solutions. 
Organizations must perform critical evaluations of 
AI solutions at the time of selection and establish 
an ongoing review process to make sure that the 
solution remains aligned with business intent and 
organizational values. AI/ML solutions should address strategy 
alignment, data integration, ethical compliance 
and risk assessment.

5,"Limited guidance on industry standard practices 
and ways to minimize organizational risks
While nearly all C-suite executives view AI as critical, 
most acknowledge the struggle to navigate the 
procurement and deployment of AI technologies. 
Enterprises must consider some key factors while 
adopting AI, including: 
 –Business strategy alignment: Does the AI 
strategy align with larger corporate strategy? 
Does the AI solution enable optimized business 
outcomes, delivering high value to the 
organization? How does it align with long-term 
organizational vision and strategy?
 –Business case: What are the non-monetary 
gains? Is the investment justified? Are 
commercial terms optimized for long-term return 
on investment (ROI) and total cost optimization?
 –Technology and data integration: Does the 
solution meet the company’s and regulatory 
data protection requirements? How do you 
regulate the outsourcing of data management and hosting? What data is needed and how do 
you collect and cleanse it? 
 –Ethics alignment: Are the AI system and 
solution provider aligned with organizational 
values and complying with ethical standards? 
 –Risk assessment: What are the risks? How 
do you conduct an initial impact assessment 
to ensure ethical, equitable and sustainable 
deployment? What are the challenges and 
successes the industry has experienced?
 –Agile and collaborative AI system 
integration: Is a scalable AI system already in 
place? How can AI applications be integrated 
into processes so they work effectively for 
delivery teams?

6,"How the AI guidebook will help
This report is a detailed, step-by-step guide that 
will help enterprises interested in acquiring AI 
solutions address each of the key considerations 
listed earlier. Each section comprises questions that 
can be used to assess and understand suppliers 
during the procurement process and will help find 
the best fit for your organization’s requirements. 
While the toolkit focuses primarily on AI software, 
it can be tailored and adapted for solutions with AI 
capabilities. These guidelines will help:
 –Provide a holistic assessment framework – by 
evaluating everything from risk to ethics and 
biases – to enable responsible acquisition of AI
 –Serve as a general, industry-agnostic guidebook 
for AI acquisition, covering areas such as 
supplier landscaping, critical stakeholder 
identification, supplier evaluation framework and 
supplier selection
 –Enable decision-making while balancing 
business needs with social and ethical 
responsibility by developing an objective 
supplier questionnaire-based evaluation
 –Provide a framework for collaboration bringing 
key stakeholders together.
The guidelines are not intended to:
 –Be a lift-and-shift solution for all industries,  
but an easily customizable guidebook
 –Outline specific regulations or laws to consider, 
but direct users towards evaluating AI solution 
providers for appropriate regulations and 
standards –Define acceptable levels for each of the criteria 
outlined but capture the relevant criteria for 
responsible AI acquisition
 –Provide a mutually exclusive, completely 
exhaustive (MECE) supplier questionnaire, 
but a directionally comprehensive 
questionnaire to aid decision-making 
on the procurement of AI solutions
 –Identify suitable physical robotic tools and  
AI hardware systems, but for AI software 
solutions/applications.
How the guidelines 
were developed
This guidebook was designed by the World 
Economic Forum’s Centre for the Fourth Industrial 
Revolution in association with GEP and in active 
collaboration with multiple Forum community 
partners representing both buy and sell sides from 
industries such as oil and gas, energy, construction 
and consulting, among others. 
It explores and incorporates key considerations 
and guidelines for responsible AI procurement in 
commercial organizations, addressing real-world 
business needs and challenges.
Over one year, the core team organized several 
workshops with over 25 community partners – 
representatives from industries and AI solution 
providers – to coalesce collective knowledge of 
AI and procurement and design standardized 
guidelines that can be adopted easily across 
organizations and industries.

7,"How to use the guidelines
Before an enterprise invests in AI solutions, it should 
consider the key principles outlined in this report. 
These guidelines are meant to be followed only 
after determining that AI is the best solution for the 
specific problem. The guidelines shared here are 
not meant to be a one-size-fits-all solution for any 
and all challenges that private sector enterprises 
may face, but by shaping the way new AI solutions 
are procured, they can improve the overall fit of the 
AI solution in the organization.
Handling each AI acquisition separately can lead 
to a lack of alignment with the organization’s 
overall strategy. The evaluation of AI solutions 
requires inputs from multiple internal stakeholders, 
each best suited to evaluate the solution on 
specific parameters. It’s crucial to have a unified, 
collaborative approach in evaluating and selecting 
the AI solution. Internal separation and lack 
of communication within an organization can 
obstruct the effective functioning of artificial 
intelligence systems. The procurement team (or, 
at an enterprise level, the procurement leadership team) for whom these guidelines are primarily 
designed can serve as the central point to ensure 
that all stakeholders are involved in a timely and 
appropriate manner, leading to a cohesive effort in 
acquiring the solution.
The guidelines in this report are designed to assist 
stakeholders in advancing their AI goals and to 
provide direction for the procurement of AI-driven 
solutions. They will help:
 –Business teams to accelerate the achievement 
of their targets
 –Procurement teams to create requests for 
proposals (RFPs) for AI products and manage 
the procurement process efficiently 
 –Data teams and practitioners to safeguard 
organizational interests and identify and manage 
potential risks
 –AI-solution providers to better understand the 
core expectations in enterprise AI projects 
and align their proposals with the emerging 
standards for AI procurement.

collaborate to ensure a holistic evaluation of the 
AI solution under consideration. Within these 
teams would be data scientists, data architects, data engineers, legal and risk management 
professionals, product owners and business 
analysts, among others.

10,"The AI acquisition 
framework
Assess and benchmark solutions to ensure 
your organization’s AI investment is responsible, 
ethical and aligned to larger business goals.
The foundation of responsible AI acquisition lies in 
a holistic framework with ethics and sustainability 
at the core, driving business goals, commercial 
objectives and data strategy, all strongly supported 
by an ongoing governance, compliance and risk 
strategy. There are underlying interconnections 
among these elements, nuances that should be 
factored in during implementation. The purpose 
of the developed framework is to ensure that 
the acquisition of AI systems by commercial 
enterprises is grounded in ethical principles with 
strong governance to ensure those principles 
are applied, thereby mitigating bias and driving 
resilience. The AI procurement framework provides 
comprehensive directional guidelines rather than 
prescriptive rules, as the degree to which these 
factors apply to an AI solution or an enterprise 
can vary significantly. While it is sector agnostic, 
there could be sector-specific concerns that this 
framework is not designed to address.In the subsequent sections, this report discusses 
in detail the impact of each of the five pillars of 
responsible AI acquisition strategy, highlighting 
the key considerations and questions that should 
be raised and addressed internally (within an 
enterprise) as well as externally (with the supplier 
partner/solution provider) through the sourcing life 
cycle and supplier relationship management (SRM). 
The report also shares a set of preliminary 
questions distilled from the comprehensive 
assessment questionnaire (see Appendix) as a first 
step for organizations considering an AI solution for 
the first time. 
While procurement can be the orchestrator driving 
the implementation of this framework, a strong 
partnership among the concerned functions will 
determine its success.

12,"As the benefits of AI, from boosting speed and 
productivity to improving forecasting and decision-
making, become more and more visible, its use 
cases are multiplying. However, prioritization, 
strategic planning and evaluation will determine the 
long-term winners in the AI game. 
One of the key considerations in procuring an AI 
solution is to evaluate and determine the strategic 
fit and capabilities of the solution in terms of the 
enterprise’s current and perceived future needs. 
Impressed by the inherent capabilities of AI 
solutions in the market, organizations often try to 
force-fit the solution to meet their requirements. 
That is one of the primary reasons AI solutions fail 
to achieve desired business outcomes. 
In order to find the most suitable AI solutions, 
enterprises must define their desired business 
goals and link them with the capabilities they want 
to build. 
It’s just as important to align the AI solution with the 
organization’s technology and data strategy as AI will have a broader impact beyond the immediate 
application area in the long run. AI centre of 
excellence/data teams must be involved right 
from the start while determining the scope, timeline 
and potential organizational impact.
Solution adaptability should be another key 
consideration. Over time, an organization’s 
business goals could evolve, or there could be 
changes in the underlying technology landscape, 
meaning the solution must adapt to new 
requirements and continue to achieve the desired 
outcomes. Additionally, the AI solution should 
be able to detect and handle gradual and abrupt 
concept drifts and incorporate the required 
algorithm changes. The solution should also be 
evaluated for capabilities to scale on demand with 
minimal complexities.
The solution provider’s thought leadership 
and vision in the AI application domain and the 
underlying core AI techniques can help ascertain 
the ability to deliver on the organization’s desired 
business goals.
Achieving business goals: questions to ask TABLE 3
Specifications Key considerations
1.1   How will the AI solution deliver on 
expected business outcomes?
Understanding how the solution will help 
enterprises meet their business goals. –Is the supplier able to understand your business goals and explain how their 
capabilities will help achieve them?
 –Are the solution’s capabilities outlined clearly, and are there demonstrated use cases 
they can reference?
 –How much custom development will be required for the AI solution to meet your 
requirements?
 –What level of guarantee does the solution provider give for the process and business 
outcomes?
 –Could the solution scale up to meet increased demand/productivity?
 –If your business slows down, is the solution flexible enough to adjust to the  
changed needs?
1.2    Is there transparency about what the AI 
solution can and cannot achieve?
         Often, businesses are not fully aware of the 
internal working mechanism of the AI model 
being used. It is the responsibility of the 
solution provider to educate potential buyers 
and be transparent about the capabilities and 
limitations of their offering. –Does the supplier explain the techniques applied in the AI system, including the use of 
algorithms and associated software libraries for the algorithms?
 –Is the supplier able to articulate the workings of the solution in an easy-to-understand 
manner?
 –Does the supplier dedicate the required resource(s) to train/educate your team about 
the AI solution?
 –Does the solution offer explainable results and transparency in the decision-making 
process? 
 –Does the supplier recognize and describe any limitations of the AI system for the 
problem you want addressed?
1.3    Can a non-AI solution deliver the same 
outcomes?
         Like any other technology, AI is not a magic 
bullet for all problems. It is essential that 
businesses explore alternative technology/
solutions before deciding on an AI solution. –Can you justify why the use of AI/ML is the optimal approach to meeting the specified 
business goals?
 –Can any other cost-effective, non-AI technology or process be used to achieve the 
expected business outcomes?

13,"Specifications Key considerations
1.4    Is there an inherent feedback loop in the 
system to adjust to changes in the external 
environment?
         An AI solution can become a self-learning 
system, provided a sufficient and appropriate 
feedback loop is embedded into it. –Does the solution have an automatic feedback/retraining loop, or is there a human in 
the loop?
 –How does the solution measure business outcomes and user satisfaction? How do 
those insights get delivered and/or feed into any product changes or updates?
1.5    How effectively can the solution be 
updated to accommodate change in 
requirements?
         AI is a highly dynamic system, so the supplier 
should partner with the buyer to redesign 
the solution in case business requirements 
change. This would be applicable especially  
if data complexity is high.
         *A steady state is when the system is acting 
in the intended manner, and all high-severity 
incidents are resolved –How easy is it to adapt or customize the solution during the initial and steady state*? 
Does the solution update its behaviour based on newly ingested data?
 –How will the supplier help in course correction if the AI model or prediction delivers 
unexpected results?
 –How is the service tested and monitored for model or performance drift over time?
 –Does the supplier provide KPIs for monitoring any performance drifts that may prompt 
retraining of the model (if there are unexpected changes)?
 –Does the supplier provide documentation detailing how the AI system can be 
reconfigured or adapted if the results are not delivering the goals?
1.6    Is the supplier a thought leader in  
this domain?
         All new technologies require partnerships 
with suppliers that are thought leaders in this 
domain as their vision will steer the solution to 
meet future requirements. –How much does the supplier invest in R&D in the domain of their solution and 
company requirement?
 –How does the supplier product development stay in line with market trends?
 –Does the supplier publish reports offering industry best practices and actionable 
insights in terms of optimizing AI outcomes?
 –Does the supplier organize in-person/virtual networking events for its clients to 
increase awareness of existing AI solutions?
 –How does the supplier solution differentiate itself from its competitors?

15,"Business strategy defines how organizations 
want to achieve their business objectives and is 
complemented by an accompanying commercial 
strategy that defines how much an organization 
would be willing to spend to achieve those goals. 
Generating commercial benefits for the enterprise 
is one of procurement’s key goals. In this case, 
it means identifying the most suitable AI solution 
with the most favourable commercial terms. These 
terms include cost, duration, payment terms, 
invoicing plan, discounts, rebates and investment 
risk, among others. However, commercial strategy 
should not be viewed solely through the lens of 
monetary returns; rather, it should focus on the 
value delivered for the money invested.
As for all investments, procurement should ensure 
that the purchased AI solution can deliver on the 
organization’s ROI expectations. ROI should include 
the overall value and potential benefits generated 
for the organization. Choosing and defining the 
most suitable KPIs – while challenging for new 
technologies with many unknowns – is crucial for 
continually monitoring whether the investment is 
yielding value at all stages.The commercial considerations for an AI solution 
should be approached with slight variations 
compared to investing in other technology 
solutions. The timeframe for TCO is usually three 
to seven years for a non-AI solution. However, 
AI is typically deployed for a longer term, so the 
cost considerations should include a much longer 
timeframe. Also, the ongoing cost of retraining 
and managing concept drifts will need to be 
considered while calculating the TCO.
When it comes to new technologies, it is important 
to manage uncertainties of business outcomes. 
An effective AI system will deliver invaluable 
outputs to any business. However, as with all new 
technology, the learning curve and the unknowns 
carry unforeseen risks. This makes it imperative 
to have strong governance in place to protect 
investment. Supplier risk assessment, performance 
management and appropriate risk mitigation plans 
with linked financial compensations are a few 
factors to consider. Organizations should look to 
include outcome-based pricing models to drive joint 
accountability and mitigate their investment risk.

16,"Specifications Key considerations
2.1    What is the expected value of the 
solution to be delivered?
         Commitment to business case 
requirements will be a key ingredient  
in a supplier partnership.
         –In what ways is the supplier committed to achieving the business case objectives?
 –Are there any dependencies/assumptions made by the supplier on achieving these 
objectives?
 –Are there ways in which the value delivered is optimized during the steady state*?
 –Will the solution require any co-development/co-innovation? How will you benefit from the 
potential gains of the supplier in case of co-innovation?
2.2    Do you understand all the costs 
involved in the purchase and 
maintenance of the AI system?
         Determining the viability of an AI solution 
for a longer or shorter term can be done 
by calculating the TCO, which includes all 
direct and indirect costs throughout the 
lifetime of the solution – from acquiring, 
building, running to retiring.
          *Much of the cost of AI projects is 
internal; the process of getting data 
ready to enable an AI solution is time-
consuming and expensive.  –Can the supplier provide a breakdown of one-time costs based on project milestones/

to mitigate investment risks. –Is the supplier able to delink the discovery and execution phases to restrict upfront 
investment while the business case is being tested?
 –Can the solution/implementation be in phases and gradually widened to avoid large 
upfront costs? For e.g. implementation of a low-cost model or proof of concept before

3. The effectiveness of the AI solution in terms of analysing valuable data depends on the quality of the data and the accuracy of the AI algorithm."
18,"Analysing data and learning from it is the 
fundamental job of any AI solution, so providing 
relevant data is an important first step. A robust data 
strategy serves as the foundation for any successful 
AI deployment. 
Organizations will have to prepare the input dataset 
for the AI solution, and the costs associated with this 
will be different. For instance, the cost will be higher 
for those with data swamps rather than data lakes.2 
Next comes the question of data relevance. Even 
if the data is available, is it the right data? Will it be 
sufficient to generate an exhaustive list of use cases 
for the purpose and scope of the AI solution? How 
can this data be accessed? The project business 
and central data management teams will have to 
work jointly to arrive at these answers. If the internal 
data available is insufficient for training, and the data 
acquisition costs are high, then generating synthetic 
data from the available internal dataset or going to the market for synthetic data sources may be the 
next best approach.3
In parallel, organizations should start thinking about 
their future data strategy as they will have to 
manage the evolving requirements that arise from 
AI implementation. They should explore potentially 
suitable data platform(s), build a scalable data 
pipeline, establish a centralized data governance 
mechanism to act as a support function and 
enable smaller teams to execute a top-down data 
strategy, devising policies and procedures for 
effective data management and adherence to legal 
and regulatory requirements.
Organizations can also consider making use of 
business opportunities from the data they collect. 
How can additional benefits be derived from data 
being traded back to the market/ecosystem in terms

Driving data for success: questions to ask TABLE 5
Specifications Key considerations
3.1    Do you have a clear and 
defined as-is and to-be  
data strategy?
To maximize business value 
from implementation of the AI 
solution, organizations need to 
assess, identify gaps and adopt 
a long-term data strategy. –What type of data platform does your organization currently have in place? How will the new AI 
implementation impact your existing data platform?
 –What is the enterprise data structure strategy if you are planning to migrate to the cloud and use 
cloud-based AI capabilities? What data will go on the cloud? Are you looking at single or multi-
cloud providers? Do you want to prioritize modularity or flexibility?
 –Is there an existing data culture across the organization?
 –Is senior leadership involved in establishing and communicating data strategies? 
 –How are different parts of the organization incentivized to share and reuse data? Are employees 
being trained in data quality management?
 –Does the data-based feedback need to be looped back into business decisions and how?
 –Is there a designated team for data collection, validation, storage, governance, security and 
accountability structures across the entire data supply chain? 
 –Who is responsible for ethical data use in the enterprise?
3.2    What are the different sources 
of data to be considered?
For organization-specific 
contextual learning process, 
internally available data is 
ideal. Otherwise, external 
sources of data (synthetic 
data) can be considered. –What are the different kinds of data expected to be ingested by the AI solution?
 –Can the AI solution meet existing and new enterprise objectives based on internally available data?
 –Do you know where and how to collect the data internally? Is the available internal data ready to be 
consumed – is it accurate, complete, consistent and up to date? 
 –Will external sources of data be needed? What is the cost of acquiring/generating synthetic data?
 –Can the external data provider ensure complete, relevant, unbiased and timely data? Who is 
responsible for ensuring the quality, usability and reliability of third-party data?
 –Should there be different contractual provisions for the exchange of different categories of internal 
data and related data models outside your organization? For example, you may want to limit/
encrypt sharing of data/data models built on personal identifiable information (PII)-related data.
 –Is the collection of additional data necessary in the future for optimal AI performance?
3.3    Does the supplier 
have satisfactory data 
management practices?
The data for the AI model should 
meet data quality standards 
defined by the governance team. 
Furthermore, data ownership 
and management, right from 
storage to extraction, need to 
be efficient, secure and adhere 
to regulatory requirements. –Does the supplier have adequate data quality assurance processes and frameworks around 
storage, management and transfer of data?
 –Who will have the ownership and be accountable for the data and derivative models?
 –Does the supplier have the standard data privacy/security frameworks for its industry?
 –How will the supplier follow data privacy practices for sensitive data that falls outside of the General 
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)?

20,"A responsible AI system upholds ethical 
standards of fairness, transparency, inclusivity 
and accountability while being environmentally 
sustainable and balancing profit with social 
responsibility. 
The best way to ensure that your organization 
invests in a responsible AI solution is by having 
dedicated internal stakeholders take responsibility 
and accountability for various facets of the AI 
implementation process. For instance, the chief 
analytics officer or chief data officer could oversee 
data governance, providing AI-focused training 
to staff and collaborating closely with third-party 
providers of data, AI services and software. A 
dedicated team or function could oversee project 
direction and change management; another team 
could oversee the execution, solution adoption and 
performance tracking.However, certain pitfalls (such as bias and coding of 
unethical standards into the system) can corrupt the 
AI solution. Designers could unknowingly introduce 
bias into the model, or biases may enter the 
system through a training data set or during training 
interaction with end users. Hence, eliminating 
bias should be one of the top priorities during the 
selection and deployment of an AI system. The 
solution provider should have sufficient checks 
and balances within the system to eliminate or 
minimize potential biases and ethical issues from 
the outcomes. It’s also important for the supplier’s 
development team to be aware and consciously 
adopt an ethical mindset while designing and 
building the system. An ideal partner will have 
a mitigation plan in case the AI solution starts 
producing biased outcomes. Conversely, these 
biased outcomes can be pre-empted if the supplier 
prioritizes diversity and inclusivity within the team 
from the initial stages.
Seven core values for ethical AI TABLE 6
    Common good: The purpose 
of AI solutions should be to 
accelerate the development of 
society and improve quality of life

should be compliant with 
standards and legislations, and 
accountable for the outcomes and 
impacts of the solution.

of harm, either in the intended 
or unintended outcomes of its 
use, and that it is not used for 
nefarious purposes.
    Accessibility: AI technology 
and the knowledge on its 
development, deployment and use 
should be made widely accessible 
so that individuals can develop the 
ability to use AI technology and 
understand the potential it brings.    Transparency: The decision-
making process of the AI 
algorithm should be easily 
explainable, and developers 
should be transparent about 
its purpose and intentions to 
promote fairness and equity.
    Equitability: AI solution 
designers should keep in mind 
equitable outcomes for all – 
from vulnerable communities 
to people with disabilities.

Equity and Inclusion in Artificial Intelligence, 2022.
Emerging ethical risks such as misinformation (e.g. 
deepfakes), over-reliance and loss of skills, which 
already exist in some sectors today, could now 
affect many services in the supply chain because of 
the extensive use of AI. For example, AI-powered 
chatbots in customer service can lead to over-
reliance on AI, no human involvement and a lack of 
empathy in the redressal of complaints, which can 
reduce customer satisfaction. Mitigation measures 
for such risks need to be addressed with suppliers 
during due diligence and should be embedded in 
commercial clauses. 
Sustainability metrics are just as important when 
evaluating an AI solution. In its current form, AI is 
not a sustainable solution. Sustainability in AI would 
mean developing AI systems that are compatible 
with sustaining environmental resources for the 
present and future generations. A responsible AI provider should have a clear road map to mitigate 
the environmental impact (such as a high level 
of energy consumption and resource depletion) 
caused by the technology.
Enterprises – the buyers of AI solutions – must also 
have processes in place to encourage the adoption 
of a responsible AI solution. Employees within the 
buyer organizations must have the right incentives 
and be recognized for doing the right (sustainable) 
thing. Companies should have a vetting process 
as part of their AI system’s pre-implementation 
review to ensure that ethical and sustainable 
considerations have been addressed. Also, an 
organizational framework should be developed that 
maps the roles and responsibilities of each team 
involved and an escalation procedure in case of 
questionable actions. Companies 
should have a 
vetting process 
as part of their 
AI system’s pre-
implementation 
review to ensure 
ethical and 
sustainable 
considerations 
have been 
addressed.

by you? 
 –Does your solution address new ethical risks such as misinformation, over-reliance 
and loss of skills?
4.2   Describe the process for ensuring that  
the solution development team adopts an 
ethical mindset.
The development team must be aware and 
responsible while designing ethical standards 
for their AI solution. –Does the AI and ML team take responsibility for how their work will be used?
 –What are the ethical standards encoded into the AI solution?
 –Does the supplier offer training or have an awareness programme to ensure its team 
understands the potential impact of creating an AI system that produces an incorrect 
or disproportional output? If not, would the supplier be open to AI ethics training 
offered by your organization?
 –Have there been any instances in the past when the AI has not met performance 
requirements and delivered unintended results? What were the corrective measures 
taken for better outcomes?
 –Is there any redressal mechanism if individuals are affected negatively?
 –Does the supplier consider user accessibility needs during design thinking? For 
example, many facial recognition technology (FRT) cameras are ineffective for 
individuals using wheelchairs as they cannot be lowered to an appropriate height.

prevent the engineering of AI systems that are inconsistent with its organizational 
values? 
 –Does the supplier have a whistle-blower protection policy?  
 –Does the supplier work with law enforcement and/or military agencies? What type of 
AI is being supplied to these organizations? For instance, providing a biased facial 
recognition system for policing can create problems.
 –Does the supplier provide responsible use guidelines? Does the supplier have a 
glossary of terms for ethics?
4.4   Is the supplier concerned about the 
environmental impact caused by its AI 
solutions? What steps are being taken  
to mitigate the impact?
Evaluate whether the solution provider  
has a clear road map in place to mitigate  
the environmental impact caused by the  
AI technology. –What is the supplier’s monthly (average) energy consumption (kWh)?
 –How much energy (kWh) is spent every month by the supplier for training its  
AI solutions?
 –What are the measures or techniques the supplier has adopted to optimize its overall 
energy consumption?

24,"While AI can deliver an incredible increase in 
benefits, the consequence of its errors can be just 
as huge. Every industry faces a different kind of risk 
based on target data collection points, regions, data 
safety and legal compliance, among other things.
Data sourcing is one of the key focus areas to 
manage the risk associated with deploying an AI 
solution. Today, enterprises have a vast volume of 
data to exploit, but this comes with issues such 
as data privacy and geopolitical and cybersecurity 
risks. Data breaches can destroy business 
reputation, lead to legal actions and result in huge 
loss of revenue. The average cost of a data breach 
in the US has almost doubled over the last 10 years 
jumping from $5.4 million in 2013 to $9.4 million 
in 2022.4 Another damaging risk related to data is 
bias in algorithms. The AI model learns from the 
dataset it is trained on, and bias in the dataset can 
result in undesirable outputs. 
Cyberattacks are another significant risk. These 
have the potential to impact the integrity of the AI 
model’s decisions and predictions; hackers can 
take control of the solution or deliver manipulated 
and/or malicious inputs that result in the poisoning 
of the AI algorithm.
Used incorrectly or negligently, AI can leave an 
organization exposed to operational, financial, 
regulatory and reputational hazards. Safeguards 
must be put in place to ensure that the AI solution 
functions as intended, and this calls for a strong governance system designed with AI’s unique 
characteristics and capabilities in mind.
AI governance is the process of setting policies 
and establishing accountability to drive the 
development and deployment of AI systems in 
an organization. It’s a broad framework that uses 
a variety of processes, approaches and tools to 
ensure that an organization uses AI technology 
favourably and responsibly. AI governance 
encompasses risk management, regularity 
compliance, contractual agreements and ethics. 
When done properly, AI governance fosters agility 
and trust in an organization.
Capturing and managing metadata on AI models 
creates transparency into how AI systems are 
built and deployed, which is a critical prerequisite 
for most regulatory concerns. Many tools and 
calibrated assessments are available in the market 
that can help assess the impact of an AI system, 
areas of risk and performance. Many of these 
tools have been developed with academia and 
governments to encourage transparency in model 
reporting and drive assurance that the AI systems 
are aligned with existing and emerging regulations 
and standards. 
These assessment tools can help enterprises create 
consistent and well-defined practices that prioritize 
attributes such as accuracy, bias, consistency, 
transparency, interpretability and fairness in the AI 
model being developed.
Managing governance, risk and compliance: questions to ask TABLE 8
Specifications Key considerations
5.1    What is the target demographic for data collection for 
the model?

to consider the impact of data use on the 
target, especially in terms of privacy, consent 
and regulations related to individuals. –Is the data being collected from vulnerable demographic groups of the 
target countries?
 –If personal data is being used, is it being collected in compliance with the 
data protection and privacy laws of the country (GDPR, Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), regional laws etc.)?
 –Does the supplier have the informed consent of the individuals whose 
data has been collected, i.e. have the individuals been provided all the 
necessary information?
 –Can individuals withdraw their consent to the data collected? If so, will the 
collected data be withdrawn from the AI model?
 –What are the relevant PII categories for the data collection process?
 –Is the content moderated? (e.g. for sexuality/violence)
5.2    How has the supplier accounted for managing 
cybersecurity risks?
An important concern to be addressed early on is 
cybersecurity failures, given its potential to have a  
serious impact on the output of the AI solution. –What are the proactive measures the supplier has taken to detect and 
tackle cyberattacks?
 –How does the supplier minimize the effect of an attack?
 –Does the supplier actively perform vulnerability management to address 
common and frequent threats?

like AI into its systems, the impact of geopolitics must  
be considered. –Has the supplier accounted for the geopolitical risks associated with 
collecting data from certain disputed territories?
 –Have the risks of storing or processing data in unstable regions been 
considered?
 –Will AI pose any risk if used in such territories? e.g. can it heighten 
instability in regional politics, affect peace and security?
 –Are data collectors at any physical risk during the process of data 
collection?
5.4    Have the risks related to the project been defined 
clearly?
Due to the uncertainty of AI/ML work, an experienced AI 
modelling supplier is expected to identify possible risks

compliance requirements?
A risk management process that captures the policies, 
processes, procedures and practices across the 
organization involved in the development, testing, 
deployment, use and auditing of AI systems should  
be in place. It must be implemented effectively as well  
as be transparent. –Does the supplier conduct mandatory conformity assessments? At what

27,"Conclusion
The history of AI in enterprises dates back to 
the early days of computing when rule-based 
systems and expert systems were used to perform 
specific tasks, such as analysing data and making 
predictions. However, these systems were limited in 
their capabilities and required significant amounts of 
human input to function effectively.
The growth of AI has been exponential in the 
past decade, and AI technology is now achieving 
goals that seemed very distant just a few years 
ago. Organizations worldwide are increasingly 
adopting AI and ML to support business growth, 
improve efficiency and gain a competitive edge. 
Businesses are investing in AI-powered systems

optimize pricing, identify new opportunities and 
make investment decisions. In many cases, 
these AI solutions are deeply embedded into the 
organization’s enterprise applications, making 
recommendations and predictions and influencing 
critical decision-making.
That said, it’s crucial to approach the procurement

delivers ethical, responsible and reliable solutions, 
instilling confidence. The guidance on industry-standard practices 
and ways to minimize organizational risks while 
adopting AI technologies is very limited, and 
there’s a pressing need for a responsible AI 
procurement toolkit.
This toolkit offers a holistic procurement process

the solution providers that can be tailored as per 
the needs of the organization and the industry 
it operates in. It enables a clear understanding 
of the business strategies that are driving the 
need to procure an AI solution; the commercial 
implications of the decision; quantity, quality and 
security of the data involved; the governance 
necessary for accountability and risk management; 
and the impact on the organization’s ethics and 
sustainability policies. 
Further, it explores the role of various internal 
stakeholders – from procurement to product  
to legal to IT and others – in addressing the  
five key considerations in this toolkit, which will 
steer an organization’s procurement team in the 
right direction.

28,"Appendix
When a company ventures into the market to 
explore AI offerings for the first time, it is beneficial 
to begin with a few preliminary questions for all 
potential suppliers. These questions, meant for 
preliminary understanding and assessment, will  
help the organization understand the applicability 
and fitment of the suppliers and their solutions  
to requirements. 
Typically, commercial strategy questions are 
not included in this evaluation stage as they are 
addressed in subsequent steps of the procurement process after the scope of requirement is clearly 
defined, along with a narrowed-down list of 
comparable AI solutions.
This exercise will help streamline and focus the 
effort required in the detailed assessment. 
The following list of questions will help buyers in 
their initial assessment. To this, they can add more 
solution domain/industry-specific questions to drive 
a better understanding of the potential solutions.A1  Preliminary understanding and assessment
